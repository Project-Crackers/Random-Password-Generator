## Project Overview
This project is a Random Password Generator written in Python. It generates secure and random passwords based on the user's preferences, such as password length and the inclusion of special characters, numbers, and uppercase/lowercase letters.

The generator ensures that the generated passwords are complex and difficult to crack, making them suitable for securing sensitive information.

## Features

Generate random passwords of any specified length.

**Option to include:**
Uppercase letters (A-Z)

Lowercase letters (a-z)

Digits (0-9)

Special characters (!, @, #, $, etc.)

Ensures a mix of character types for stronger security.

Simple command-line interface for user input.

## How It Works
The user specifies the desired password length.

The user selects whether to include uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

The password generator randomly generates a password based on these criteria and outputs it.
